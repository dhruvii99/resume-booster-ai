 Intern in project DNN-based semantic segmentation for detecting weed and crop
 Mobile-Net, Neural Network, Deep learning, Machine Learning
 github://Weed Detection and segmentation
 June 2023- August 2023
 • It is an open source project, in which we built a model to detect the weed, crop and soil using Mobile-Net.
 • Trained a model to identify the weed, crop, and soil and further test that model on the Opensprayer dataset.
 • Successfully achieved the accuracy of 91 percent by training the model and testing it on more than 6000 images and got
 very accurate semantic segmentation of images determining the weed and crop.
